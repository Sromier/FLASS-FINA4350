# FLASS-FINA4350
This project is an attempt to give traders insight about short-term market reactions to YouTube trailers.  Our team has focused the analysis on 7 cinema studios (21 Century Fox, Disney, Lions Gate Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, Universal Studio, and Warner Bros) which release a significant number of film each year.  Thus, we only expect to predict small movements in their stock price as one movie does not account for a large revenue for these studios. Such movement is also expected to be short-lasting as a constant news influx and high volatility in the stock market will dissolve the influence of our insights.
